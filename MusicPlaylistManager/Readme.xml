# Music Playlist Manager (Java)

This is a simple Java console-based application that allows users to manage a music playlist.  
The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 

 Features
- Add songs with title, artist, and duration
- Remove songs by title
- Display the playlist
- Play all songs
- Search for songs by title
- Show total number of songs
- Menu-based console interface


OOP Concepts Used
- Encapsulation: Song details are private and accessed using getter methods.
- Inheritance: Song class extends the Media class.
- Polymorphism: Common methods can be used or modified in different ways.
- Abstraction: Users only see the menu, not the inner working of classes.
- Static and Final: Used to count total songs and control constant values.
